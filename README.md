# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week9: Deep Learning - Part2

This week we will first review a gentle DL tutorial, aiming to have a "high-level" understanding of the general concepts. We will then see multiple DL examples with a selection of different components and variations of DL applications. 

- [A gentle DL tutorial](https://www.slideshare.net/LuMa921/deep-learning-a-visual-introduction)
- [A DL case study: Painters Challenge](DL_Painters.pdf)
- [Data augmentation with cats](DLBasics_KerasDataAugmentation.ipynb)
- [An improved DL model using CNN](DLBasics_SimpleCNN.ipynb)
- [SHIPS segmented using a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN)](DLBasics_SHIPS.ipynb)
- [What does a convolutional layer do?](DL_VisConvFilters.ipynb)

All notebooks can be copied from and run on Google Colab:
